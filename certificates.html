<h3>Some of my works:</h3>
<p>Descriptive Writing Piece: Silky smooth collisions of the sky burst in the night’s calm, the sun descending below the horizon creating a symphony of yellow and red in the skies above. I sighed loudly as I focus back on the road ahead of me, packed with vehicles of all shapes and sizes making loud honking noises creating a fine mess. It had been an hour since I left the office and way past my supper time. My stomach roared at the thought of the aromatic food my wife would have made sitting on the table ready to be devoured. I divert my thoughts back to the ongoing traffic looking around at the other civilians stuck helplessly in this chaotic mess. Amongst them were zombie looking people who were probably returning back home after a tiresome day and impatient people who wouldn’t stop honking, giving my ears a run for its money. With hopes of staying positive, I turned on the radio trying to divert myself from the cacophony of cackling cars around me, changing the radio station to find a joyful song. But every station seemed to share the same mindset playing silver tunes of lamentation. I groaned, harshly slamming the radio button to turn it off. The sun had now fully set the night sky turning sombre, darkening my mood even more. I avert my gaze at the lit sidewalk to the left of me, seeing a group of people whizzing past me on their bikes, almost in a way to mock me for the situation I was in. Sighing in frustration I look back ahead only to see that the traffic hasn’t moved more than an inch, surely this day couldn’t get any worse. As if on cue the sky roared before heavy droplets of rain thud on the roof of my car creating the effect of a snare drum. Great, the day just got worse. 
<br />
Short scene from my book "Royal Red": The princess stared at the mirror looking at her ashen face. Her eyes moved around her dresser looking at the various objects on display, her eyes stilling at an archaic yet elegant bottle of scented perfume.  

She clutched the bottle in her hand examining it thoroughly. It was quite prepossessing, a beautiful flower design and bordered with gold paint, imported too.

 She swiftly got up and backed away from the dresser staring one last time at the mirror before skillfully throwing it against her reflection. The mirror shattered into tiny little pieces along with the bottle, her dresser filled with small serrated pieces of glass. 

The perfume diffused around the room. Amelia bent down towards the shards staring at her distorted image. “You’re just a princess, you can't do anything.” she seethed picking up one of the larger shards.

 She looked at the large portrait of herself that hung above her bed. “ A prized possession, the belle of the ball.” she swung her hand, the shard soaring towards the painting and hitting it right in the middle.

 “If only they knew what the pretty princess can do.” she raved, climbing onto her bed to get to the painting. Grabbing a hold of the shard on the painting, she dragged it down creating a sizable rip down the once gorgeous painting.

Her gaze shifted to a vase that stood on her nightstand. She reached over, tipping it over and crashing it onto the floor. She bent over her bed a tear dropping onto the broken vase. 

“Be like a porcelain doll, smile but not too much, be the perfect shape, don't speak at all, be fragile.” her sobs grew louder at her words. 

She took the small fragment of the vase and plunged it into her pillow. Feathers scattered around the room from the once fluffed pillow. Inanely, the princess proceeded to her table, swiping her hands through the various objects on it. Each landed on the floor with a thud, more fragile items broke into pieces because of the impact. 

Before she could continue her antics a knock interrupted her. She grabbed the closest thing next to her, a chair, and swung it at the door. 

“Away with yourselves or it’s off with your head.” she bellowed, the person did not dare knock a second time. Carelessly, the princess made her way back to the broken mirror on the floor.

“ This damsel in distress will save herself, no knight clad in silver armour, no prince who saves her with a kiss...Just herself.”
